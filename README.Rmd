# rnaturalearth

An R package to hold and facilitate interaction with [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) map data.

This package provides :

- access to a pre-downloaded subset of Natural Earth v4.1.0 (March 2018) vector data commonly used in world mapping

- easy subsetting by countries and regions

- functions to download other Natural Earth vector and raster data

- a simple, reproducible and sustainable workflow from Natural Earth data to rnaturalearth enabling updating as new versions become available

- clarification of differences in world maps classified by countries, sovereign states and map units

- consistency with Natural Earth naming conventions so that rnaturalearth users can use Natural Earth documentation

- data in 'sf' or 'sp' formats

The [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) website structures vector data by scale, category and type. These determine the filenames of downloads. rnaturalearth uses this structure to facilitate download (like an API).

## Install rnaturalearth

Install from CRAN :

```r
install.packages("rnaturalearth")
```

or install the development version from GitHub using [devtools](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools).

```r
devtools::install_github("ropensci/rnaturalearth")

```

Data to support much of the package functionality are stored in two data packages that you will be prompted to install when required if you do not do so here.

```r
devtools::install_github("ropensci/rnaturalearthdata")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/rnaturalearthhires")
```
